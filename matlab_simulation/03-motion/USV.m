function xcur = USV(xprev,Tl, Tr, m, ll, lr, dt)
%% Motion model for a 2 thruster USV, Such as Clearpath Robotics Heron Platform 
%  xprev = [x,y,theta,vx,vy,vtheta]'right thrust and left thrust are denoted 
%  as Tl and Tr, mass of m, perpendicular distance from thruster to cog is 
%  ll and lr for right thruster and left thruster respectivly as well as 
%  the timestep dt. It returns the new robot pose. 

%  Very rough drag calculated for Clearpath's Heron, comment this out and 
%  remove from velocity equations if using a different USV, or sub in your 
%  own vehicles properties.  Note drag for theta was not modeled, so 
%  rotational speed can get very large 
%  A~0.31364m^2, assuming drag coeffecient of ~0.7

%  F_drag = 1/2 rho C_d A v^2
F_drag=-0.5*1000*0.7*0.31364*xprev(4)*abs(xprev(4));


%update velocities
v_x = xprev(4) + ((Tl/m + Tr/m + F_drag/m)*dt);
v_theta = xprev(6) + ((Tl*ll - Tr*lr)/m)*dt;

% Motion increment in the body frame
dx_b = [v_x*dt 0 v_theta*dt]';

% Rotation matrix for conversion from body to inertial frame
R = rot(xprev(3),3); 

% Robot state update in inertial frame
xcur = [xprev(1:3) + R*dx_b; v_x;0;v_theta];
